# DataCamp-Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects that I have completed on DataCamp. Each project focuses on a specific topic or skill within data analysis and provides a practical application of the concepts learned. Below, you'll find a brief description of each project.

## Projects

### Project 1: Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office

Description: In this project, I applied the skills you learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to solve a real-world data science problem. I wanted to discover if Netflixâ€™s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.


### Project 2: Disney Movies and Box Office Success

Description: Since the 1930s, Walt Disney Studios has released more than 600 films covering a wide range of genres. While some movies are indeed directed towards kids, many are intended for a broad audience. In this project, I analyzed data to see how Disney movies have changed in popularity since its first movie release. I will also performed hypothesis testing to see what aspects of a movie contribute to its success.

The dataset used in this project is a modified version of the Disney Character Success dataset from Kelly Garrett.


### Project 3: Predicting Credit Card Approvals

Description: Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this project, I built an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.

The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
