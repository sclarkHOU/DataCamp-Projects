# DataCamp-Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects that I have completed on DataCamp. Each project focuses on a specific topic or skill within data analysis and provides a practical application of the concepts learned. Below, you'll find a brief description of each project.

## Projects

### Project 1: What and Where are the World's Oldest Businesses

Description: An important part of business is planning for the future and ensuring that the business survives changing market conditions. Some businesses do this remarkably well and last for hundreds of years. In this project, I explored data from BusinessFinancing.co.uk on the world's oldest businesses: when were they founded, and which industries do they belong to?

Like many business problems, the data I explored is contained in several different datasets. In order to understand the world's oldest businesses, I will first need to use joining techniques to merge the data. From there, I can use manipulation tools such as grouping and filtering to answer questions about these historic businesses.

### Project 2: Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office

Description: In this project, I applied the skills you learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to solve a real-world data science problem. I wanted to discover if Netflixâ€™s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.


### Project 3: Disney Movies and Box Office Success

Description: Since the 1930s, Walt Disney Studios has released more than 600 films covering a wide range of genres. While some movies are indeed directed towards kids, many are intended for a broad audience. In this project, I analyzed data to see how Disney movies have changed in popularity since its first movie release. I will also performed hypothesis testing to see what aspects of a movie contribute to its success.

The dataset used in this project is a modified version of the Disney Character Success dataset from Kelly Garrett.


### Project 4: Predicting Credit Card Approvals

Description: Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this project, I built an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.

The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Usage

Each project is contained in its own directory, which includes a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file and any necessary datasets or resources. To run the projects locally, you will need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. Additionally, make sure to install any required libraries mentioned in the project's notebook.

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/sclarkHOU/datacamp-projects.git
cd project-1
jupyter notebook
Run the notebook cells to see the code and results.
Feel free to explore and modify the code to further understand the concepts covered in each project.
