Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this notebook, I will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.</p>\n","\n","<p>I'll use the <a href=\"http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/credit+approval\">Credit Card Approval dataset</a> from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The structure of this notebook is as follows:</p>\n","<ul>\n","<li>First, I'll will start off by loading and viewing the dataset.</li>\n","<li>The dataset has a mixture of both numerical and non-numerical features, that it contains values from different ranges, plus that it contains a number of missing entries.</li>\n","<li>I will preprocess the dataset to ensure the machine learning model I choose can make good predictions.</li>\n","<li>After the data is in good shape, I'll will do some exploratory data analysis to build intuition.</li>\n","<li>Finally, I'll will build a machine learning model that can predict if an individual's application for a credit card will be accepted.</li>\n","</ul>\n","<p>First, loading and viewing the dataset. I see that since this data is confidential, the contributor of the dataset has anonymized the feature names.</p>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"6e846047-58af-480f-bad7-5bf67a80ed37","metadata":{"dc":{"key":"3"},"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <th>5</th>\n","      <th>6</th>\n","      <th>7</th>\n","      <th>8</th>\n","      <th>9</th>\n","      <th>10</th>\n","      <th>11</th>\n","      <th>12</th>\n","      <th>13</th>\n","      <th>14</th>\n","      <th>15</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>b</td>\n","      <td>30.83</td>\n","      <td>0.000</td>\n","      <td>u</td>\n","      <td>g</td>\n","      <td>w</td>\n","      <td>v</td>\n","      <td>1.25</td>\n","      <td>t</td>\n","      <td>t</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>f</td>\n","      <td>g</td>\n","      <td>00202</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>+</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>a</td>\n","      <td>58.67</td>\n","      <td>4.460</td>\n","      <td>u</td>\n","      <td>g</td>\n","      <td>q</td>\n","      <td>h</td>\n","      <td>3.04</td>\n","      <td>t</td>\n","      <td>t</td>\n","      <td>6</td>\n","      <td>f</td>\n","      <td>g</td>\n","      <td>00043</td>\n","      <td>560</td>\n","      <td>+</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>a</td>\n","      <td>24.50</td>\n","      <td>0.500</td>\n","      <td>u</td>\n","      <td>g</td>\n","      <td>q</td>\n","      <td>h</td>\n","      <td>1.50</td>\n","      <td>t</td>\n","      <td>f</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>f</td>\n","      <td>g</td>\n","      <td>00280</td>\n","      <td>824</td>\n","      <td>+</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>b</td>\n","      <td>27.83</td>\n","      <td>1.540</td>\n","      <td>u</td>\n","      <td>g</td>\n","      <td>w</td>\n","      <td>v</td>\n","      <td>3.75</td>\n","      <td>t</td>\n","      <td>t</td>\n","      <td>5</td>\n","      <td>t</td>\n","      <td>g</td>\n","      <td>00100</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>+</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>b</td>\n","      <td>20.17</td>\n","      <td>5.625</td>\n","      <td>u</td>\n","      <td>g</td>\n","      <td>w</td>\n","      <td>v</td>\n","      <td>1.71</td>\n","      <td>t</td>\n","      <td>f</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>f</td>\n","      <td>s</td>\n","      <td>00120</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>+</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["  0      1      2  3  4  5  6     7  8  9   10 11 12     13   14 15\n","0  b  30.83  0.000  u  g  w  v  1.25  t  t   1  f  g  00202    0  +\n","1  a  58.67  4.460  u  g  q  h  3.04  t  t   6  f  g  00043  560  +\n","2  a  24.50  0.500  u  g  q  h  1.50  t  f   0  f  g  00280  824  +\n","3  b  27.83  1.540  u  g  w  v  3.75  t  t   5  t  g  00100    3  +\n","4  b  20.17  5.625  u  g  w  v  1.71  t  f   0  f  s  00120    0  +"]},"execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# Import pandas\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n","from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\n","from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\n","\n","# Load dataset\n","cc_apps = pd.read_csv('datasets/cc_approvals.data', header=None)\n","\n","# Inspect data\n","cc_apps.head()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5b651042-9191-46d2-a94a-f0f69a46d1d4","metadata":{"dc":{"key":"10"},"run_control":{"frozen":true},"tags":["context"]},"source":["<p>The features of this dataset have been anonymized to protect the privacy, but <a href=\"http://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/73039_9946de135c0a49daa7a0a9eda4a67a72.html\">this blog</a> gives us a pretty good overview of the probable features.
